          The Healthcare Innovation Network is a collaborative forum and a
          marketplace that forms a direct pipeline between providers and the
          innovators of solutions designed to reduce costs and improve the care.
      p.description-intro
        |
          We hold these truths to be self evident, that healthcare providers,
          innovators and patients are created equal and are endowed with powers
          of curiosity and creativity in pursuit of happiness and better healthcare.
      p.description-intro
        |
          The Network exists to connect healthcare providers and innovators as equals,
          so that together they can better listen to each other and to patients who are
          now the center of the Innovation Universe and its ultimate customer.
